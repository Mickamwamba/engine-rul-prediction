# engine-rul-prediction
The aviation industry relies heavily on the efficiency and reliability of aircraft engines to ensure the safety of flights and the overall success of operations.
The unpredictable nature of engine failures poses significant challenges for the aviation industry. Traditional maintenance approaches, which rely on predefined schedules or usage-based thresholds, often lead to suboptimal resource allocation and increased operational costs.
Predicting the number of remaining cycles [Remaining Useful Life (RUL)] of aircraft engines has become a critical aspect of maintenance strategies

# Why is this important?

- Prevent unexpected failure.
- Reduce downtime
- Optimize resource optimization.

# ML Problem Framing

This study explored 3 different sets of problem frames as explained below : 
- Binary Classification Problem – Predicting whether the engine will fail within 30 days or not.
- Trinary Classification Problem – Predicting whether the engine is healthy or is likely to fail within 15 or 30 days.
- Regression Problem – Predicting the Remaining Number of Cycles before the engine fails.
